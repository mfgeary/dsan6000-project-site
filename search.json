    "text": "Detailed Project Business Goals\n\nSubreddit Political Engagement\nBusiness goal: Identify which subreddits frequently discuss the President or his policies to understand the spread of political discourse across Reddit. Technical proposal: Use PySpark to filter and aggregate posts mentioning the President and policies, grouping by subreddit. Analyze and visualize the distribution of posts across subreddits to see whether discussions are concentrated in political communities (e.g., r/politics) or are prevalent in general-interest subreddits. Normalize the data to account for differences in subreddit sizes.\n\n\nControversy vs. Comment Count\nBusiness goal: Analyze the relationship between the perceived controversy of posts and comment count to understand user engagement during politically charged discussions. Technical proposal: Define “controversial” posts using the controversality metric encoded in the data. Group data by subreddits, and compare using metrics like comment count and score variance. Calculate correlation between comment counts and score fluctuation, comparing across political and non-political subreddits.\n\n\nTemporal Trends of Political Content in Non-Political Subreddits\nBusiness goal: Examine how often political discussions emerge in non-political subreddits over time to track shifts in broader interest in political issues. Technical proposal: Detect political content within non-political subreddits using keyword matching and topic modeling. Track how the frequency of political posts changes over time, visualizing the results to identify periods of increased political engagement. Compare to real world events to understand the context of these shifts.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis vs. Presidential Job Approval\nBusiness goal: Compare the sentiment trends of comments in politically engaged subreddits with presidential job approval ratings to assess how online sentiment aligns with real-world political opinions. Technical proposal: Conduct sentiment analysis on posts discussing presidential policies across subreddits. Aggregate average sentiment scores by month and correlate with job approval ratings. Visualize trends and analyze potential alignment with approval ratings over time.\n\n\nCross-Subreddit Sentiment Analysis on Policies\nBusiness goal: Identify which subreddits show support or criticism of presidential policies to understand partisan leanings within communities. Technical proposal: Apply sentiment analysis on posts mentioning specific policies or topics. Use comparative statistics to assess sentiment differences between subreddits, focusing on political subreddits versus general interest subreddits.\n\n\nSentiment Fluctuation Over Time\nBusiness goal: Track sentiment changes over time across different subreddits to see shifts in public opinion on policies or political figures. Technical proposal: Conduct sentiment analysis on posts in a temporal sequence, then use time series analysis to visualize sentiment fluctuations across subreddits. Analyze correlations between spikes or dips in sentiment with political events or news.\n\n\nSentiment Extremity on Candidates\nBusiness goal: Measure how extreme sentiments are in discussions involving candidates to detect polarization levels. Technical proposal: Conduct sentiment analysis on candidate-specific posts, scoring for extremity (e.g., strong positive or negative values). Use sentiment extremity as a feature to visualize which subreddits tend to have more polarized opinions on certain candidates.\n\n\nSubreddit Prediction from Post Text\nBusiness goal: Predict the most likely subreddit for a given post based on its text content to improve content recommendations and classification. Technical proposal: Train a multi-class classifier on text data with labels as subreddit names. Use embeddings or TF-IDF vectors as features. Train on subreddits focused on specific parties and test performance on r/AskPolitics and r/politics for generalizability.\n\n\nPredicting Popularity of Posts\nBusiness goal: Identify which factors contribute to a post’s popularity (score) to better understand what drives user engagement in political discussions. Technical proposal: Use post score as the target variable and extract features such as comment count, sentiment, length, and specific keywords. Train a regression or classification model to predict popularity. Test the model’s ability to generalize across political subreddits and other engagement metrics.\n\n\nPredicting Political Leaning of Comments and Posts\nBusiness goal: Automatically classify comments and posts as left-leaning, right-leaning, or neutral to understand the distribution of political perspectives within and across subreddits. Technical proposal: Label a training dataset with political leanings (based on keywords, sentiment, or manual labeling) and use it to train a multi-class classifier. Features could include sentiment scores, word embeddings, political keywords, and post metadata. Fine-tune the model to predict political leanings across general and specific subreddits, evaluating performance based on accuracy and the model’s ability to generalize across topics and subreddits.\n\n\nPredicting Likelihood of Controversial Posts\nBusiness goal: Develop a model to predict whether a post will become controversial, helping to understand the types of political discussions that spark division and strong engagement. Technical proposal: Define “controversial” posts as those with a high variance between upvotes and downvotes, or those with a high comment-to-score ratio. Train a binary classifier with features such as sentiment polarity, political topic keywords, subreddit type, post length, and time of posting. Evaluate the model’s ability to predict controversy on unseen posts, and analyze which features contribute most to controversy in political discussions."

    "text": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
